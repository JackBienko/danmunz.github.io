Hello, blogging, my old friend.

Let me begin by scoring some Back-In-My-Day cred points:

- My _very first_ website's most time-intensive maintenance task was stripping out the garbage HTML FrontPage inserted before hitting 'Publish'.
- I remember when, if you wanted specific people to read or share your writing on the web, you had to _email them personally and ask them to do so_.
- I have been a member of several blogrings. No, I am not telling you which ones.
- My gut reaction to the "new" idea of static site generators (I'm using one right now!) was to chuckle and reflect on the number of Movable Type themes I've built in my day.

So, blogging and I, we've been around. I've been writing for the web, on and off, personally and professionally, for over a decade. But, it's been a while. I haven't written seriously for the web &mdash; that is, with a consistent tempo, tone, URL, or anything, really &mdash; for a good long time.

So why now? There are three reasons: The personal, the professional, and the global.

##The personal
As you may know if you follow me[^familyfollows] online, my lovely wife and I recently welcomed a new addition to our family:

{% include image.html url="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8640/16153506600_a37ebe887b_b.jpg" description="Ladies and gentlemen, meet Ava June Munz. Nine pounds of smiling, pooping joy. " %}

Having a newborn at home has two specific consequences, which interact with each other in an interesting way. The first is that you have a ton of time in which you're simultaneously not doing anything *and* not available to do anything.[^notime] The second is that being a new parent &mdash; spending the majority of your waking hours staring at a living creature that is biologically and existentially at least half you &mdash; makes you kind of contemplative. It ever so slightly nudges upwards the psychic value of following your idle thoughts through to the end; of recording them or somehow pinning them down; of asking questions and developing viewpoints; of gradually-but-frantically trying to become a person with the level of answers and wisdom and all-around cluefulness that my daughter will one day (way too soon, probably) come to expect from her dad. You sit there thinking of something-or-other and just as it's about to escape your mind, a reflex kicks in: *Hey, wait, I should have a well-thought-through opinion about that, or at least the vaguest idea what I'm talking about*. I'm enjoying this new habit of mind, but it creates a need for blank canvas.

The result is that I have a rare combination of time to think, cause to reflect, and motivation to write. Blogging turns out to be an ideal format for someone in my situation. So, here we are.

##The professional
Despite the above motivations for writing, this space isn't going to be all pees and poops.[^pees] *Je ne suis une daddyblogger.* While my writing here is utterly and completely separate from my day job &mdash; more on that later &mdash; I hope to use this space to write a bit more about my professional life. If you consult my [CV](/cv), you'll see that I've spent the past decade or so at the interesting intersection of technology, digital engagement, and the public sector, and the past four years in various roles at what might fairly be described as a tech-startup-slash-federal-financial-regulator. In that time, I haven't really paused to reflect on what I've learned from these fairly unusual experiences &mdash; at least not out loud &mdash; and go through the mental process that turns the coal of experience into diamonds of insight. For a variety of reasons, I feel like I'm in a good space to start doing that (see also: contemplativeness!), and doing it out loud &mdash; i.e., online &mdash; has the potential to make it a much more useful and fulfilling exercise. Consider my writing here an ask, by me, for your help thinking things through.

##The global
If you follow [me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/dan_munz), whence I currently do most of my public talkin', you'll note that I'm...mildly curmudgeonly about today's technology scene. ([Exhibit A](https://twitter.com/dan_munz/status/478232144251486208), [Exhibit B](https://twitter.com/dan_munz/status/509872668771115008), [Exhibit C](https://twitter.com/dan_munz/status/559180414804176896).) I'm the first to admit that this is about forty percent analysis and sixty percent temperament, but in any case, one exception to this outlook is the medium of blogging. Amidst the growing army of coastal millennials Yo-ing bitcoin to Amazon to pay for drone-delivered 3D printers[^seventy], I don't think there's ever been a more exciting time for good old-fashioned gold-standard blogging. Good tools for writing are becoming stupid simple (this relatively technically complicated site took me all of 15 minutes to set up and deploy), and while social media is a truly horrifying place to *have* discussions, it's incredibly useful as a surface on which ideas can travel until they find people who will engage with them. (There's even [a burgeoning movement dedicated to this idea](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE).) So, in addition to having free-ish time and motivation and some latent thoughts to share, I'm just plain excited about writing for the web again.

##A few ground rules
Before we begin:

1. While I am writing here in a professional capacity &mdash; i.e., as a person with the perspective of my professional interests and experiences &mdash; I am *not* writing here in an official capacity, ever, period. My writing doesn't reflect, represent, or even imply agreement by, any entity at all other than me.
2. This blog adheres closely to [Deming's Law](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/compliance/in-god-we-trust-all-others-bring-data/a/d-id/1268616?), but even more closely to [Cunningham's Law](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law). My goal in writing, for the most part, will be to explore and raise interesting questions, not answer them definitively, and as such I'm comfortable with frequently being wrong/under-informed. It's an intentional knowledge-seeking strategy. 
2. I have a comments section. I'm going to do my damnedest to (a) actually write well enough and consistently to garner comments, and (b) to engage with the ones I do get.
3. Speaking of audience participation: This blog is written in a framework that makes it pretty easy[^githubeasy] for you to engage with my content by directly editing it. I've always found this to be cool but mildly gimmicky (this is a blog, not a group spreadsheet), but if you feel so inclined, I've put a "contribute" button right at the bottom of each post. Prove me wrong.

Okay, let's roll. What should I write about?

[^familyfollows]: Or any of my immediate family. Or extended family. Or pretty much anyone who'd show up in my "DNA Relatives" column on a 23andMe results sheet.
[^notime]: Examples include: Waiting for the bottle to warm up; administering the bottle; observing [tummy time](http://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/sleep-naps-12/tummy-time) sessions; waiting to see if that poop was the only poop or part one of a series; waiting to see if she's asleep enough to swaddle; waiting to see if she's still asleep post-swaddle.
[^pees]:Minor delight of being a new parent: Hearing actual medical professionals, who went to school for approximately twelve hundred years, use the term "pees and poops" with complete and utterly clinical earnestness.
[^seventy]:Okay, it's seventy percent temperament.
[^githubeasy]: Easy for people who use and understand git/Github, anyway. *Vox populi vox dei.*
